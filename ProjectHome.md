**UPDATE** **Please see the Full Wifi app now released in the Market which provides a GUI without requiring root.**

Non-root users on Android have no read/write access to /data/misc/wifi/wpa\_supplicant.conf where Wifi network configurations are stored.

Using the android-wifi-nonroot project codebase you can manually setup a complex wireless network such as PEAP, LEAP, MSCHAPv2, etc.

If you are new to development tools such as Eclipse, follow the [Eclipse Android guide](http://developer.android.com/intl/de/guide/developing/eclipse-adt.html) to get started.

Once you are setup, check out the code via svn and follow the instructions in the comments.

Good luck!
